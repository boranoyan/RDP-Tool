# RDP-Tool
This script provides a streamlined way for users to select a server and initiate an RDP session

# Description

This script reads in a list of servers from a file called "server.txt" and uses them to create a drop-down list. The drop-down list is divided into categories, which could be based on things like geographic location or department. Users can then select a server from the drop-down list and use it to initiate a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection.

Overall, this script provides a streamlined way for users to select a server and initiate an RDP session, which can be especially helpful in situations where there are many servers to choose from. The use of categories also makes it easier for users to quickly find the server they need, rather than having to scroll through a long list of server names.
